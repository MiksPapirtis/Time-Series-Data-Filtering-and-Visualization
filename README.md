# Time-Series-Data-Filtering-and-Visualization
This repository contains a Python script for filtering using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The script utilizes the Fourier domain to filter out high-frequency components, providing a smoothed representation of the original data. The data used for demonstration is a time series of power values with daily cyclic patterns.
